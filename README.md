# Telegram Bot
 A simple telegram bot written in native python


The following is a simple python script to quickly create a telegram bot in order to have a little bit of fun. The basic idea is to initialise the bot with a piece of text; which when entered by any user following the bot will result in the bot sending a random picture of a dog to the user.
